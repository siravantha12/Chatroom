# team-dijkstra ChatRoom Application

This project is to implement an asyncrhonous chatroom using Node js. The chatroom will be a website that will allow users to create chatrooms and invite users to chat. This project will address criticisms of other similar chatroom applications such as Slack that implicity enforce syncrhonicity by making the application fully asynchronous.
